## Use defer or async on Script Tags

**Impact: HIGH (eliminates render-blocking)**

Script tags without `defer` or `async` block HTML parsing while the script downloads and executes. This delays First Contentful Paint and Time to Interactive.

- **`defer`**: Downloads in parallel, executes after HTML parsing completes, maintains execution order
- **`async`**: Downloads in parallel, executes immediately when ready, no guaranteed order

Use `defer` for scripts that depend on DOM or other scripts. Use `async` for independent scripts like analytics.

In Vite SPAs, generated module scripts are handled by Vite. Still apply this rule
to any manually authored third-party or local `<script>` tags in `index.html` or
other HTML that the app injects.

**Incorrect (blocks rendering in `index.html`):**

```html
<head>
  <script src="https://example.com/analytics.js"></script>
  <script src="/scripts/utils.js"></script>
</head>
```

**Correct (non-blocking in `index.html`):**

```html
<head>
  <!-- Independent script - use async -->
  <script src="https://example.com/analytics.js" async></script>
  <!-- DOM-dependent script - use defer -->
  <script src="/scripts/utils.js" defer></script>
</head>
```
